<h1 align="center">graphiql-cli</h1>
<p align="center">A simple CLI to run your GraphQL queries in the terminal!</p>

<br/>

### Why ?

The idea came up one day as i was trying to use [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) to run my graphql queries but it was too difficult and annoying.
<br/>
So i just made this CLI =D


### Installation

After download, just run:
```
go build
```
And run the program:
```
./graphiql-cli
```

<br/>

Or you can get a binary in the [releases](https://github.com/LuisHenriqueFA14/graphiql-cli/releases/) page.


### Examples:

<img src="./static/print2.png"></img>
</div>
